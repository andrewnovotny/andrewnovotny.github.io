title: Thoughts on The Art of Doing Science and Engineering
---

## Intro
After stumbling onto a half-dozen people recommending this book on X.com (The Everything Appâ„¢), I figured I'd give **The Art of Doing Science and Engineering: Learning to Learn** by Richard W. Hamming
 a read. Recommendations were hyperbolic as they usually are, but
from the premise noted and background of Richard Hamming I was intrigued. Poking around online for a copy ended up being more of an adventure than I bargained for as the book
hadn't been in print for a few years and most places were stocked out for 2-3 months. I finally tracked a copy down off eBay after a few days of searching.

This book is a collection of disjointed thoughts from a great mind. In many ways, this book reminded me of
**The Creative Act: A Way of Being** by Rick Rubin. **The Art of Doing Science and Engineering** was more focused on how Hamming's technical discoveries came to fruition and general advice for other technical personnel
while **The Creative Act** was more focused on Rubin's method of finding inspiration and creativity. Nevertheless, **The Art of Doing Science and Engineering** was an enjoyable and relatively easy read once it was accepted that the
theory/math based portions are for example of his thinking process and not 100% critical to enjoyment of the book.

Unrelated to the contents, the cover looks pretty bad ass.

## Favorite Parts
S-Tier Chapters: 26, 27, 28, 29, and 30 

A-Tier Chapters: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 18, 19, 20

All others were alright, but either more in the weeds than I was looking to go or less applicable to my daily life.

## Thoughts

The first 25 chapters had good nuggets interspersed with the explanations of various technical topics that he worked on. It was interesting to read, however much of this was lost on me.
The signal to noise ratio increased dramatically in the last 5 chapters. Here he tied together many of the loose ends established in the earlier chapters into a cleaner package, however
I believe the value of the ending chapters largely remains even if the initial chapters were omitted. Given this, recommending this book to friends has me suggesting only reading 
the last 5 chapters, then going back to earlier chapters if something seems particularly interesting.

### Good Quotes
"Change doesn't mean progress, but progress requires change" (397)

"In an argument between a specialist and a generalist, the expert usually wins by simply (1) using unintelligible jargon, and (2) citing their specialist results, which are
often completely irrelevant to the discussion. The expert is, therefore, a potent factor to be reckoned with in our society. Since experts both are necessary and also at times 
do great harm in blocking significant progress, they need to be examined closely. All too often the expert misunderstands the problem at hand, but the generalist cannot carry
through their side to completion. The person who thinks they understand the problem and does not is usually more of a curse (blockage) than the person who knows they do not
understand the problem." (333)

"If an expert says something can be done he is probably correct, but if he says it is impossible then consider a second opinion." (336)

## Conclusion
After finishing this book, I found myself thinking through the thought experiments, noted pitfalls, etc on a daily basis. Many of the issues that I thought were unique to my 
situation now seem universal. This book pointed me in a direction of self-reflection and deeper examination of the world around me. If you go through life searching for hidden doors
eventually you might find one that changes your life's trajectory. Ultimately, I enjoyed this book and I'd rate it 4.5/5 stars.
