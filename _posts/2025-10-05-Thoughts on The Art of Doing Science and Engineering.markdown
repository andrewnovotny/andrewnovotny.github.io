title: Thoughts on The Art of Doing Science and Engineering
---

## Intro
After stumbling onto a half-dozen people recommending this book on X.com (The Everything Appâ„¢), I figured I'd give it a read. Recomendations were hyperbolic as they usually are, but
from the premise and background of Richard Hamming I was a least intrigued. Poking around online for a copy ended up being more of an adventure than I bargained for as the book
hadn't been in print for a few years and most places were stocked out for 2-3 months. I finally tracked a copy down off eBay after a few days of searching.

Unrelated to the contents, the cover looks pretty bad ass.

## Background
I was born and raised in the North East. I hate to say "I was groomed to engineering from a young age", but by the time I was in middle school, I knew what I was going to do. 
Throughout school, I did fine academically, but loved competing and pushing myself to see what was possible. 
Something about pushing myself to find the end of my capability felt right.

I was spread relatively thin between 3x seasons of Track & Field, Robotics, and Boy Scouts in addition to taking classes at the local community college, but always made it work.

For college, I didn't plan ahead too much, but knew I wanted a few things:

- Top notch engineering
- Away from home
- Possible to run Track & Field

While touring campuses, I saw Rose-Hulman's Branam Innovation Center (BIC) and chatted with the Formula SAE (FSAE) team. Similarly, their Track & Field team was pretty competitive for being D3.
I ended up getting accepted and enrolling the Fall of 2018. The next three years and change in Terre Haute, formed me into the person I am today. I attribute Rose with giving 
me a rock-solid engineering foundation, introducing me to my brothers, and instilling new personality traits such as 'just make it happen' and 'relentlessly focusing on what matters'.
While at Rose, I ran Track & Field my freshman year before realizing, if I want to be a top tier engineer, I need to relentlessly work on growing my engineering skillsets.
This had a strange effect as I'd need to learn skills to be competent on the Formula SAE team, but then later would relearn those skills formally in the classroom.
I am extremely blessed to have approached Rose in the manner I did as it let me understand much of my coursework practically before learning theoretically.

Upon graduation, I was hired by SpaceX in Cape Canaveral, Florida working Falcon Booster Refurb. I can go off on many tangents about my time in that role, but I learned a ton in the 
primarily operationally focused role. As the process solidified, I was assigned ownership of the Landing Leg system at the launch sites. This allowed me to start to dive in on composite repairs,
root cause analysis, and technical communication (to technician performing labor and to parallel engineering organizations/owners).

After working this role for a little over a year and a half, a new opportunity arose to become a designer for Ground Support Equipment (September 2022). I seized the opportunity and have been working
on adding new capability to Falcon and managing ongoing maintenance since. Main projects I've worked in this role have been:
- B398 Pressurized Ground System
- Falcon Heavy Leg Stow
- Architecting a project management system
- 3117mm PLA Stand (First use on HaloPPE)

## Conclusion
This is a general cross-section of my life thus far. More depth will be added at sporadic intervals through the miscellaneous stories and projects I share here.
